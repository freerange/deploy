freerange/deploy
================

Allows simple, git-based deployment on freerange-compatible servers (see assumptions below)

How to use
----------

In your project, create a Capfile, like this:

    require 'freerange/deploy'

    server "gofreerange.com", :app, :web, :db, :primary => true
    set :application, "gofreerange.com" # defaults to the name of the repo at origin

Next, prepare the server:

    $ cap deploy:setup
    
This adds a git remote to your local repository, and creates an apache virtual host configuration on the server, and performs the initial git deploy. To deploy again, just push to 'production'

    % git push production master



Assumptions
-----------

1. You're deploying as 'deploy'
2. You're deploying to /var/www/<application>
3. Your apache is setup to read vhost files from /var/www/apache_vhost
4. The deploy user has write access to that directory
5. The deploy user is a sudoer
